    # bio="I'm originally from San Francisco (and the surrounding area), but I've spent the last year or so living in London. I've previously worked at Google, iFixit, Adode and Punchd. \r\n\r\nBeyond that, I'm a contributor to Fog (a ruby library for managing the cloud), and spend a lot of time thinking about managing distributed systems and deploying code. I like consuming and creating \"Art\" (painting, photography, music, books, old, new, street, whatever) and enjoy a good game of D&D.\r\n\r\nI love a good cup of coffee or pint of beer, and a nice long walk to find either.\r\n\r\nI'm currently unemployed and considering jobs in New York, Seattle and the Bay Area."
